# KKrReporter
Project is during writing, i hope soon you will help here tool that allows prepare reports at the easiest way that we can imagine. 
Application is inspired MVC :) (litle bit)
As Model we are using database and sql query, 
View can be definied by XLSX file 
Controler ... it is comand line you can use bat file and shedule app to generate reports each day authomatically. Very ofthen we have 
to prepare some ad-hoc reports for bussines. Most often that time we write SQL file run that file at Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio,
Toad or something similar and paste results to excel. Ater some time we have to generate report once again. I would like make that litle 
bit more simpler and add few additional fuctionalities like generate report with pivot table or some chart by one click or without any 
action if we use sheduler. Such reports can be generate to Dropbox forlder, shared folder, or something similar and at that way easly 
distiributed to interested persons. As a lot of tools i crated that to make my live easier and I would like share that app with you.

Orginal app was write at write use forget style so now rewrite parts of orginal code to make that litel bit better (still not perfect) and 
app is still not ready to use, but it will be ready soon.
